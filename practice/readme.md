## word Guess
This file was a dry run before I worte the word guess game

## review2
This has two parts inside it
<br> 1. build a deck of chard and deal them.
<br> 2. ask the user for how many dice and how many sides the dice have and displays the roles and total(no real user input checking).

## review 3 aka work guess game
This scirpt could be mroe efficient but it works. <br/> 
The user is shown a hidden word: ***** and given a number of guesses to figure the word out.  If they do the user wins if no they lose.
